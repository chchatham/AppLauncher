# AppLauncher

This is a node.js application developed in Electron (with the Photon UI kit) for launching arbitrary applications
which might require otherwise-redundant startup parameters. There are also basic checks that the computer battery
is charging and that the system volume is all the way up.

It should work across platforms, and should compile to nice GUI-based installers. We'll see.
